## Challenge 1
    Challenge 1 asked for an app to be able to add Menu Items with properties of 
    meal numbers, lists of ingredients for the meals, a name for the meal, a description of the meal and lastly a price. The cafe manager needed to be able to add meals, delete them, and see a list of them all.

## Challenge 2
    Challenge 2 was an Insurance Claim app that asked for a claim object with the properties of Claim ID, Claim Type, Description, Claim Amount, Date of Incident, Date Of Claim, and whether or not the claim itself is valid. The claim type required usage of a ClaimType enum which held to the types of Car, Home, and Theft. From the app the claim manager needed to be able to see all the claims in the queue, take care of the next claim in the queue, and enter a new claim into the queue.

## Challenge 3
    Challenge 3 asked for an app that would essentially allow us to track what badges at Komodo have access to what doors in the building. This required the use of Dictionaries and Lists. The badge object needed properties of ID, list of doors it has access to, and a name for the badge.  In this challenge I had to create a dictionary of badges and give the user the option to create a new badge, update the doors that a certain badge has access to, delete all the doors that a badge has access to, and show a list of all the badges and all the doors it has access to.
